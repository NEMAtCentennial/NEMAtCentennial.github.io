This is a celebration of a multidisciplinary field, from Software Engineering, to Biotechnology, Robotics, Mechanical Engineering and Food Science, engineers come from all walks of life and all disciplines.

  	<h3>National Engineering Month at Centennial College</h3>
  	<p>This is not Centennial College&#8217;s first time celebration National Engineering Month.  A group of passionate and dedicated students entered into OACETT&#8217;s National Engineering Month competition and celebration last year.  The focus of the event was DNA as a Future Storage Device, and was presented by who presented on the topic of DNA as a Storage Device.  The turnout was excellent and everyone who attended loved it and learned a lot.

    <div id="collapse1" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
      <div class="panel-body"><p>What&#8217;s your passion? We can tell you ours! Some of us love Robots.  Some of us love living organisms.
      We&#8217;re fascinated by viruses, bacteriophages, and synthetic biology.  We&#8217;re fascinated by the minute and the micro.
      Some of us are fascinated by medical devices and cancer and human tissues.
      Some of us work with bacteria while some of us work with engines and gears or code.
      It&#8217;s highly likely that one of us will be influenced by what another of us is learning about.
      We&#8217;re not just in our program because it&#8217;s our favorite thing, we&#8217;re likely here because it&#8217;s practical,
      because there&#8217;s some application for it that will help society, because there&#8217;s a demand for it in the job market.
      We might even be unsure as to why we are here, but we&#8217;re certainly learning along the way.
</p><p>We here at Centennial College have planned an event that is broad in scope.
Engineering is not limited to one field, it has many different sectors, so we have decided to celebrate its multidisciplinary nature.
Engineers keep us warm, safe, clean and healthy.  They provide systems that heat and cool air during different seasons,
design and build walls and lighting systems that provide shelter and visibility,
they figure out the mechanisms that allow us to filter water and air and they create systems that keep us healthy,
from blow dryers and sanitation systems to advanced medical technologies.  We want to say thank you.  We hope to learn more from you.
We hope to contribute and better society too.  The multidisciplinary nature of engineering has created, overall, a better society.

        Goals of National Engineering Month</a>
      </h3>
    </div>
    <div id="collapse2" class="panel-collapse collapse">
      <div class="panel-body"><p>Naturally, for us as students, the goal of National Engineering Month is encompassed in the idea of learning.
      We like to soak up as much as we can, while we can.  The opportunity to learn outside the classroom is appealing.
      It can be different and refreshing, and we aren&#8217;t marked on it!
</p><p>However, while we learn and share our own knowledge, we would also like to make this event practical and beneficial for the community in another way.
We have invited the charity Let&#8217;s Talk Science to National Engineering Month, and we will be raising money for this worthy charity.
Is there a better way to encourage youth to partake in science than by supporting an organization that specializes in that already?
It was a hard choice as there are so many worthy causes &#8211; but we think this charity fits with our theme.
</p><p>Simply put, our goals are: Awareness, education, and raising money towards this goal.</p>

      <div class="panel-body"><p>Ask yourself, what got you into science as a youth? Events like this can have a big impact.
      We want to have a big impact, so we are reaching out into our communities by inviting high school students.
</p><p>Our target audience fall under four categories.
Those who love science and engineering and have a basic understanding, those who love science and engineering and have a solid understanding,
those who loves science and engineering but don&#8217;t know where to start, and those who don&#8217;t have an opinion &#8211;
we&#8217;d love to get you excited too.  We strive to offer something for all.
We&#8217;re looking to inspire and inform individuals of all ages, but we will primarily be focusing on the age-group of 15 years +.
